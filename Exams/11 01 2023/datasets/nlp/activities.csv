"Newer isn't always better: If you have ever played the earlier version of life please do yourself a favor and avoid this ""new"" version like the blak plague. My friends and I used to play the old version every single day up to late hours. Once we learned the new version was out we ran and bought it. WHAT A DISAPOINTMENT!!!! Compared to the old version this one is HORRIBLE. It isn't fun. The new rules [are not good]. You can not bet anymore. Money isn't the way it used to be (what's with the litte pieces of carton?) Maybe if someone at MB reads this they will go back to the basics and bring back what was once a great and fun family game to play. Lucky for us we still have, and play with, our old and much better version of Life.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

"Have never seen a worse movie.: Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco must be related to Kornbluth...as well as anyone who writes a positive review about this film. Instead of a ""winning comedy"" (as Lasalle leads the unassuming consumer to believe), Haiku Tunnel comes through with the worst plot line, acting, gimmicks and comedic attempts to ever be put on film. Kornbluth, looking eerily like the Principal from Billy Madison by the way, has just made the day of anyone that has had anything with the movie ""Ishtar"". We now have a new heir to the thrown of the title ""Worst Movie Of All Time"". Do not waste your time...",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

"wish I'd read it when I was younger: The best part, in my opinion, is about school system and kids stuck in there. Parents, get this book for your kids - if they are 14 or something, and smart, and already feel the pain, this will really help them a lot.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE
Illogical!!: A particularly illogical piece of CAD software! In my opinion a fundamentally flawed program which will do nothing other than waste your time!,REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE
"I smell fish...: Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau make a dynamic duo, hilarious to watch as the feed off each other perfectly. In this popular comedy they do so to the nth degree as John & Max, two bachelors fighting over the same woman. That woman is the eccentric and interesting Ariel (Ann-Margret) who just moved into their Minnesota neighborhood snowmobile in toe. She almost immediately takes a liking to John (Lemon) who is smitten with her, but as his age long feud with Max (Matthau) heats up he is almost driven away from the idea of romance, leaving Max to swoop in and try his turn with Ariel. The film flows wonderfully and packs enough hilarious scenes to justify watch after watch. Like Martin & Lewis, Lemon and Matthau work wonders together!",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE
"Restored my faith in rock music: In the mid 80s I lost interest in rock music - it all seemed derivative and boring. It was then that I discovered jazz and I didn't buy a rock album for 15 years. A couple of years ago I heard jazz pianist Brad Mehldau play Radiohead covers (Exit Theme and Paranoid Android)so I bought OK Computer. What a revelation! OK -I can do without the teenage angst lyrics, but the music is wonderful. Now I've come back I hope some Radiohead listeners give Brad Mehldau a try.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

"Is this man a prophet?: This is Kirk Brandon back to his cheeky best. I bought this album by mistake, when trying to purchase a book about voyeurism of medieval poets (hence only the four stars). Even so, I have been quite chuffed with this happy little accident.On track 8, Spear of Destiny have a song that has never sounded so relevant as it does now (Babylon talking). As many will know, Babylon is the old name for Baghdad, and that has certainly been talking recently. Similarly, track number 11 is Captain America. And we all know who's boss now. Track 12 is ""chemical head"" (warhead, more like) and 14 is Burn Out, evoking pictures of oil fields burning. Really, this is the Nostradamus of all albums, spookily predicting the current Gulf War at the same tim",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE
"The Movie's Better: If you liked the movie...well, watch it again. It's way better than the book. Brin gets credit for the cool main idea, but it's developed better in the (notably different) movie. The execution in the book just isn't very good--and like most sci-fi, the book's poorly-written. By the standards of sci-fi, I guess it's o.k...maybe alright for the beach or whatever. But really just not very good. I love post-apocalyptic fiction, and even I found myself skimming to the end.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE
"A Manual of Proper Etiquette by Robert Jordan.: 214 pages into the book and only two events have happened that moved the story along. Otherwise Jordan's subject has been so and so wore this type of dress, in just this way, made of this cloth, tailored in just this way, and spoke and acted liked this. And if she didn't, she was severely punished. I've had enough of the spear carriers holding center stage on the proper manner of drinking tea. No more for me, thank you. I won't be there when Rand's inevitable victory at Tarmon Gai'don is won. Perhaps someday a condensed version in 5 or 6 volumes will tell this story as it should have been.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

"The Five People You Meet in Heaven: If you are looking for a book you wont want to put down then Mitch Albom's The Five People You Meet in Heaven is the perfect book for you. I read this book for an assignment in school and found myself unable to stop reading it. The vivid details and real-life connections made throughout the story made it come to life. I found myself relating many of the things in the book to my life and to many of my close friend's and family member's lives.I thoroughly enjoyed this story of love, loss and friendship. By page count, this story is short however, the number of deep thoughts and heart grasping events in the book made it anything but short. I would suggest this book to anyone enjoys realistic fiction with a dreamy twist.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

"I Agree With The Previous Review: I was eyeing this product for a long while and to my delight I found this at Best Buy for $19.00. Happy that I found a Dusty Springfield release at Best Buy at all I quickly grabbed this, paid for it, left, got in my car and read the track listings at red lights on my way home. As I got closer to my home I realized the ""story"" is a bit limited, in fact really limited, to Dusty's Universal recordings, we fans who know her chronology by heart know what album's are not represented. The ""informative"" liner notes state ""Cameo"" marks a low point in Dusty's career. Was the person writing the liner notes listening to the same ""Cameo"" as we?? Slanted as this collection may be the mastering is superb but it's really too brief. For a",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

"Avoid this Product: This unit is made of extremely cheap, low-grade plastic. Less than two weeks out of the box, one of the fans began to grind and make noise periodically. The upside was that Targus agreed to replace the unit; the downside was that they wanted five weeks to do it. Five weeks! What am I supposed to do in the meantime?This is the first product of its type that I have owned, but I was pretty shocked, given its price, at how flimsy it was when I took it out of the box. Since I purchased it, the price has dropped drastically (at least temporarily), but knowing what I know now, I wouldn't buy it even at the reduced price.

Cornwell Should Sue!: I loved the book so I looked forward to the movie and was greatly dissapointed. This movie should be ashamed for destroying the title of this book.

I recomend if you want know more about the Anti Christ.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE
"Hated it: I brought this book having been led to believe that it was suitable for an older audience. It didn't take long for me to realize that it's not. This book is clearly meant for young adults.Even so, I didn't think this was a good book. I've read books for young adults (I am 32) and enjoyed them very much. This was not enjoyable at all. The prose was weak, the characters boring, everyone was either too happy and nice, or too evil and mean. It was very slow and not very descriptive. I didn't care about anyone, or what happened to them. Many of the characters were unbelievable. Sometimes, I even found it hard to believe that the animals were real! I can't think of a single other book I've read when that has happened - when the animals in a book don't",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE
"BRILLIANT MOVIE: You will NEVER forget this movie. As he proved in Mystic River, Sean Penn is an amazing actor and this movie wouldn't be the same without him. I think he should have gotten an Oscar for his performance in this.Dead Man Walking is about a nun (Susan Surandon) who receives a letter from a man, Matthew Poncelet, (Sean Penn) on death row. He asks her to come visit him, and they get to know eachother. At first the nun tries to help him prove his innocence, but when that fails she turns to helping him accept Christ and prepairing him for his execution.This film is so moving, it will bring tears to your eyes and will make you re-think your opinion of the death penalty. An absolute MUST SEE!!",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

"Not even worth watching on the telly!: I heard about the making of this movie since it was practically filmed not far away from my hometown. Given that it involved western New York and southern Ontario, I thought it would be a good thing.Oh, was I proven wrong. I didn't get a chance to watch it in theatres, but I did watch it on VHS with a few friends back in late 1995. This movie just could not hold my attention (or theirs, for that matter) nor was it anywhere close to have us laughing in stitches. I don't care if it was meant to be Michael Moore's way of being perpetually condescending and opposed to conservatives or if this movie had been done by a conservative. It just flat out wasn't worth the money to rent it for wasting our time to watch it.Accordin",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

"BRUFORD'S RHYTHMIC TOUR DE FORCE: Without question, Bill Bruford is the greatest drummer of his generation, with a creative thirst unmatched by any other working artist. This recording, visually as well as sonically, is a joy! The remarkable interplay among the musicians delivers a cross-polination of ideas that build to a veritable rhythmic tsunami. There is no rock-star preening or inane pounding. Instead you have subtlety, nuance, grace and daring at every turn. The melifluous streams flow Arican, Hispanic and European, pouring forth as this one irrepressible world rhythmic cadence. The essential instrument for dance has always been percussion and it is here in spades, obviously, with enough inspiration to have you discard any concern for a top melody l",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

"Stunk so bad I turned it off!!: After watching Bernie Mac in a number of his movies I found his comedy extremely funny. This movie is up there with the worst of animated comedy I have ever seen. The main character's annoying high pitched voice was enough to infuriate anyone. The jokes were extremely lame and the plot didn't go anywhere. If you want to suffer through 75mins of your life this movie is the one for you. Any comparisons between this movie and South Park are clearly not valid as South Park is actually funny. If you want my advice on the film I say ""you could burn your money and get a better investment out of it than buying this one""",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

"Not quite worth it: If you're not bothered by the fact that the writer can't write, misses words and replaces caren-characters with normal characters - and even calls a male person ma'am, then you might want to buy this book. Otherwise it's not worth it.You'll probably learn something from this book, but since the author has a bad attitude towards grammar (many things are given as ""you'll learn this eventually, don't worry"" and nothing more), the book doesn't give you that much. For a traveller it might give the required knowledge, but it is certainly NOT a ""complete course"" to Slovene.Fortunately I have a friend that is native in Slovene and can help me out.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE
"Over 1000 pages of nothing: This book is terrible - it's incredibly frustating to use. It's worthless as a reference and I doubt that anyone has ever read it cover to cover (including the army of authors that wrote it).

What I need to know about JavaScript could probably fit in a book half this size. This book is over 1000 pages, it's poorly organized, the index is bad, and it doesn't focus on relevant facts about the language.

"Great premise -- terrible execution: The whole idea of miracles, saints, and how to ""prove"" such things, is fascinating. Unfortunately, in the hands of the author, the scenario becomes a cartoonish exercise with stereotypical and poorly drawn characters. Some of the scenes actually made me cringe, they were so crudely written and unbelievable. The dialogue is clumsy and at times downright laughable; I wondered where the editor was when the manuscript was being prepared. I stuck with it because I thought the premise was a good one, but it was a total waste of time. I can only hope that in the proposed movie version that they hire a scriptwriter who knows how to write dialogue and create a plot that works. Mr. Vetere certainly doesn't.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

If you're looking for insightful comments or suggestions on raising your only child, you won't find them here. The author is much more interested in justifying her choice to have had only one child.

Do not expect to find the next Dimmu Borgir, Cradle of Filth darkwave sounding band. This is fast paced, in your face grind from two men who have been in the business for several years.

"An interesting read for those who love the sea !: I must disagree with the earlier reviewers. While the book would have benefited from a more thorough editing and proofreading process, I nonetheless greatly enjoyed reading it. It appeared to be well researched and the author obviously has a passion for the subject. I found the Stevenson family fascinating. The descriptions of the building of the lighthouses, particularly the great ones; Eddystone, Bell Rock, and Skerryvore, imparted a sense of both the excitement in attempting such daunting projects and the tremendous difficulties that were overcome to build the structures. I also enjoyed the illustrations, but wish that more had been included. I would recommend this book to anyone having an interest in th",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

For example, it's got the best version of ""Baby, Please Don't Go"" I've ever heard, merging Europe, America and Africa.The Five Blind Boys only show up on a couple of tracks, but they are good. Mostly it's Knut and the Africans. But the opening track has nothing to do with Africa: it's an improvisation based on a Norwegian folk song.

"Thinking and Destiny: Thinking and Destiny by H.W. Percival is one of the most remarkable books ever written. It deals with the age-old question, Quo Vadis? Where did we come from? Why are we here? Where are we going? He explains how our own thoughts become our destiny, as acts, objects, and events, in our individual lives. That each of us is responsible for these thoughts, and their affects on us and others. Percival shows us that what appears as ""chaos"" in our daily lives has a purpose and Order which can be seen if we will begin to focus our thinking, and begin Real Thinking, as outlined in his masterpiece. Percival himself acknowledges he is neither and preacher nor a teacher, but presents to us a cosmology based upon Intellingence. A Universe of Order",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

The characters were completely opposite in personality from what one recieves in the first impression. The only part that was slightly irritated me was the character attitudes.

Well, I've just finished watching it, and I wish I had my money back. It is unlike Jane Austen altogether with weird implications regarding Mr. Bertram's conduct in Antigua. All the other one-star reviews are accurate, but here's a little more in case you're still not convinced: (Spoiler Alert) Mary Crawford actually stands up amidst the entire family and states (out loud) her wishes that Tom die so that Edmund can inherit the estate.

"Tiresome and chessy sci-fi: This book, as can be gleaned from the title falls into the category of cheesy sci-fi.

I sent a e-mail to the Criterion a few time ago asking if they were by any chance planning to release this title and I was very happy to receive the positive answer.Though I agree with most people that 8 1/2 is a good work, it is this Fellini film (his first film in color) that I keep mostly carefully in my memory and in my heart. I love this film. Fellini himself once said that this film was very misunderstood by the european audience and was better received in the EUA, for the motive he gave to the psycological matter of the film.

His albums AFTER this one do not come close to the earlier ones like Tumbleweed, Madman, Honky Chateau or Don't Shoot Me. GYBR is a very good album- with some great material.

"Milking it for More than it's Worth.: I'm a 23 year old, and I was a huge fan of Shrek, a pretty big fan of Shrek 2, but I wasn't impressed by the Shrek the Third trailers. Shrek the Third has very little plot and no true character development. It's stagnant. It really feels like a collection of all the deleted scenes from Shrek and Shrek 2. Each scene is over the top and becomes irritating before it finishes. Many of the characters phase in and out of character. Worst of all, the movie seems no longer to have an adult appeal. It's a kids movie with a story so stupid you'd have to be a kid to not notice.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

See others find it insane the way some dvds are packaged in that way, but you have to realize companies are never going to give in to our complaints. Just either don't take it out as much as you want to or put it in a cd case.For some people that care alot about extras this set is not for you, otherwise BUY IT.

"Rush - 'Fly By Night' (Polygram): Review no.84. Originally released in early 1975,this was the band's second record. I don't CARE what numerous young {er} whipper-snappers (age 18-30) say about this lp, 'Fly By Night' is a TRUE '70's progressive/album rock gem. Sure,most of the later day Rush releases are decent (some in fact,are great), but there is nothing(I repeat,NOTHING!) like Rush's first four albums. What I've always dug SO much about this CD reissue is that even though I'm a huge live album fan, I still like being able to check out the 'original' versions of tunes like the Canadian trio's classic rock opener, here ""Anthem"", the epic ""By-Tor And The Snow Dog"" (if this song doesn't make the hairs on your neck stand up, you should seriously listen to",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

It takes that concept further than most doctors would, not only preventing the big killers (Heart attack, heart disease, diabetes, etc.) but also the common flu, allergies, and other childhood illnesses. He has a no-holds barred attitude about society's norms and morales, and it's a refreshing but not overly paranoid view of the food world we live in.I'm already a vegan but it gave me some great ideas on some things I should be adding to my children's diet as well as my own.

Next time I'll read the blurb, misleading though it often is.For a movie to be any good, it needs a story. And in that regard, this movie is an abysmal failure. It is one of these 'theme' movies, in which the issues of what's happened in their lives becomes the main story, instead of secondary issues picked up in a main story.The result is a movie which goes nowhere, does nothing, and is totally and utterly boring.A star line-up, yet what a waste!

To be sure, there's some contrived tension arising from some shady characters threatening physical violence and the hope that you're still reading The Firm.

"Yawn: Like the above Amazon review states, Fear dot com is a total mess. Director William Malone throws away such things as character development and sensible storytelling to go for pure visceral thrills and shocks; something that worked in his 1999 remake of House on Haunted Hill, but it doesn't work it all here. The talents of Stephen Dorff and Natasha McElhone are wasted here as neither's character is allowed to develop, thus both actors give lacking performances. The story revolves around an internet site visited by four people, all of which died 48 hours after visiting the site. The screenplay is loaded with plot holes and contrievances, hardly explaining anything of the going's on. Genre stalwarts Udo Kier and Jeffrey ""Re-Animator"" Combs are on board",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

My only gripe is that the recording level is a bit low, so you've got to crank the volume quite a bit (still sounds great though, especially w/ headphones).

On watching it on DVD I wish I had viewed the whole when it first aired. It really sneaks up on you in subtle ways, and is very deep emotionally. It doesn't have the production values or the beautiful prose of Brideshead (Jeremy Irons gets drunk and slurs Saaaamgrass into a phone in that one) but the performances are excellent, especially Lydia, she plays the part brilliantly, and reminds me of several people I have known in my life.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

The incidental music included here, ""Ellie's Theme"", ""The Man Hunt"", ""Mayberry March"", and the tear-inducing ""Aunt Bee"" all bring back fond memories of this classic 60's series, maybe the best TV show of all time. My only complaint about the album is the sequencing, which I assume is the original sequencing. For instance, track #2 is the 8 and a half minute comedy monologue by Andy called ""Jack, The Giant Killer"", which would work better, IMO, near the end of the CD. I have resequenced my CD-R copy of this disc with the first 6 tracks being: 1. The Andy Griffith Show 2. Ellie's Theme 3. The Man Hunt 4. Flop Eared Mule 5. Mayberry March 6.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

Bosch hotline was not very supportive or helpful, and plan on spending a minimum of 45 minutes on hold. Between hotline, the plumber and electrician they finally decided it was a bad control board. Told me they would overnight a whole new water heater, but shipped it 3-day ground instead (which with the weekend meant 5 days). Now 15 months later we have the same problem all over again.

Instead of building any sort of strong narrative, author John Everson chooses to burden readers with Kieran's horny daydreams and creepy thoughts for a girl barely out of high school, or overload us with the graphic details for raunchy roadside sex and a teenaged girl's masturbation fantasies.

I have read TWITW over 25 times in my 38 years, and each time it touches a chord in my heart. Very few other books that I have read create such beautiful mental imagery for me of the wonders of nature and leave me feeling so spiritually refreshed.

My Favorite Christy Moore CD: 'Live at the Point' is Christy Moore at his best. A wonderful blend of traditional Irish songs magnificently performed by this accomplished artist. I usually don't like 'live performances' but this one is an exception. While listening to 'Live at the Point' you actually feel like you are in the audience and enjoying an exceptional performer doing what his does best. It is a uplifting experience and I can (and do)listen to it over and over again. I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes traditional Irish music.,REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

"The Worst Biography I've ever Encountered: Without footnotes or bibliography, the author claims to reveal to us the ""hidden"" Danny Kaye. Instead, he serves up a large dose of contempt and putdowns, and his own subtle and not-so-subtle hostility for his subject. The more I read, the angrier I got, until I decided this book was not worth finishing. It's far more revealing of the author's mental and emotional state than of Danny Kaye. For me, the book is an insult, not just to Danny Kaye, but to the reader as well. Danny Kaye certainly deserves a careful in-depth accurate, definitive biography. Instead, this book appears to be an intentional character assassination piece. I don't remember any other book that has been such a turn-off.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

It now has a more cinematic feel on the Blu-ray (as well as a bit more image on the left and the right). The packaging is similar to the first season, though the book can now be removed from a sleeve. Strangely, the cover of the book reads: ""le GUERRE dei CLONI"".

"Belt Support Broken While Using: I love this back pack design, but the belt support is clearly not as durable as it should be. I have owned it for a few months, but only used it about 10 times around the house. My son is about 20 lbs and there has been no extreme use or wear and tear. There is a plastic flat piece that is the back middle of the belt support. It has holes stamped in it to allow the belt support to be raised or lowered. As I was walking with my son, I pulled to tighten the belt and the whole plastic part split in half. This left the entire belt support split in half (see customer photo).

"A Once Great Brand: When I graduated college, I went to the local department store and purchased a suit and a pair of Rockport wingtips. Those shoes were comfortable and lasted me a very long time. Ten years later, I think I have worn my last pair of Rockports. Sadly, the quality is not there any longer though the comfort is. Rockport (a Reebok company now) has replaced the Vibram outsoles with a foam outsole that wears out in weeks and squeaks like those toddler squeaky shoes that are so cute . . . on a toddler. The squeak is embarassing and I can't spend $75 every month. I have now moved on to a Rockport imitator. Thankfully there are several in the department stores. Brands to consider: Croft & Barrow, Deer Stag, and Dexter.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

A built in on switch so it doesn't have to be unplugged to shut if off is nice.

When he marries the strong willed Billie early on, he is not the powerhouse man of his movies. She becomes an obstacle between his family and their adoptive children. If this is not disappointing enough, you will also plow through excessive analysis of every character Cagney ever played. I've seen most of those movies, haven't you?

Two examples of the TU folks at their best.""Rejoice, Rejoice"" is not such an album.

Naked Lunch is read and applauded simply because of its unconventional approach, and not for its content. It has been considered controversial ever since the first printing, and is still admired solely for that reason. If you needed to read the entire book through to get his simple message, then you probably never got it, anyway. If this book was rewritten, with the same message, but minus the gratuitous sex, it would sell about a dozen copies.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE
"Not just pretty pictures: I bought this book because I like to see pictures of beautiful bridges, and I knew the author's reputation for great photography. However, there was a huge bonus -- the author's entertaining and informative stories behind the building of the important and/or beautiful bridges. Some parts of the descriptions could be dry at times but it is easy to skip to the next paragraph if you fell like you're getting bogged down. He also devotes time to why the bridge was important in the development of bridge architecture. Plus, you'll get stories about the people who designed and built the bridges. The author clearly has a love affair with this form of architecture -- he sees the art as well as the functionality aspects of b ridge building.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

It is obvious that he has attempted to sensationalize the event, rather than just honestly report the events and the facts of the case. There is no bibliography to record his sources and the reader has to just take his word for it regarding where he got his information.

A third novel (and I'm sure the 20 or so sequels that followed this one) was not needed at all.As mentioned in the title, I found this third novel really disappointing. I stopped reading it a couple of times because I found it so tedious and dull (which was never the case with the first two novels), and was glad it was over when I finally finished it!Honestly, the only good part about it was seeing Tarzan's determination to save",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

"Shelters of Stone: Don't believe the hype.The massive amount of research which clearly went into this book does not make it a good story. There's no plot; no tension; no suspense. Much of it is actually a clip show, with Ayla and Jondalar endlessly rehashing their past adventures and inventions. Nothing of note happens. A & J return to the Zelandonii, mate, and have a kid. There are hints of conflict with the Clan but nothing happens. The characters are plastic, too-perfect people and the writing is slow, static and rife with both authorial intrusion and needless info-dumps.Pages of truly bad rhyming religious doggerel -- which are, along with much else in the book, repeated several times -- add a touch of ludicrous awfulness.It's boring.

Bjork turned out to be a disappointment. Her vocal technique is so-so, and her lyrics are largely insipid. Obviously, many people like her work, but for me(a member of the minority) her music just doesn't do very much. Maybe after listening a few more times, I will finally see the light.

Bova simply comes across as mildly anti-religious.4) Much of the novel seemed downright dull, plodding - as if Bova was terribly bored with his own creation and simply going through the motions.I really wonder if the sequels are any better, or if they're even worth the effort.

Check out track 27 (""Beat Dat B*tch Down"") and listen how precise his riffs are, elegantly counterpointed against the sly scatting of Lil Prick's syncopated falsetto dirge, taking you deeper into modern urban alienation than any rapper since Killer G.

"a parable: Christianna, the heroine of this novel, is engaged to Joshua, who has left her for some indefinite period of time, with the fervent promise to return. In his absence, however, she starts to think that he might not in fact reappear and is tempted by a charming stranger. However, this story being a parable of the christian's life, he does return. What happens then is the greatest surprise and miracle of all.I simply love this book. It is a most beautiful portrayal of God's faithful love for the most sinful human being, and it is also a metaphor for the believer's struggles in this world, where sometimes it seems the Lord's second coming is delaying beyond our endurance.Joshua's love brought me a clearer idea of Jesus' love for me (and also reminde",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE
"pointless with cats: I tried this on our two cats, since neither one likes to be brushed with a normal brush. One bolted under the bed as soon as I turned on the Ionic Brush, the other one fidgeted but endured it with a little help from my wife.Problem: most cats don't actually stink, so the main purpose of this brush---deodorizing without a wet bath---is kind of lost on them. As far as detangling, reducing shedding and dander, it's not much better than a normal brush.

excellent again: I purchased the Visitor about a year ago because I thought the cover art was quite excellent. I was surprised to find a band that easily rivals Dream Theater and Enchant in my collection. This album is no differant. I dont find Immortal? to be that differant from the Visitor. The vocals are similar and I believe have only become stronger with this release. Arena creates almost a novel like story with their music and this is but another great work with another strong concept (reminds me of Neil Gaiman's American Gods). The only problem was that this cd was quite short even witht he 20 minute epic in there. Friday's Dream is a beautiful song.,REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

It is nice not to have to transfer the breast milk from one container to another. I cannot comment on the freezing aspect since I did not make enough milk to be able to freeze. The only downfall to the liners that we found is measuring out the quantity is not accurate if the liner isn't fully expanded. We measure in a different container and pour into the liner. The best part about this system is that we are sure that the container holding the milk is clean- we just don't trust a regular plastic bottle to come completely clean.

Our thermostat is now not shutting off at all(in a 5 month old kettle), meaning the kettle is now an electrical hazard, and like the previous reviewer, I have discovered that the warranty is almost worthless.

Quite a lot of the early part of the book is taken up with warnings to the neophyte, totally unnecessary in my opinion but maybe a warning not to operate heavy machinery is in order.

From the minute you read the protagonist's name, which is right out of soap operas or romance novels, and follow her mannered, mechanical thoughts, you feel that you're reading about purely manufactured people. Even if the ending is a surprise, there is no suspense, because the story and characters are completely contrived, and the writing has all the style of a High School creative writing contest runner-up.

The base of the handle has an internal mechanism where in the closed position you turn it a quarter turn and it locks in place so it won't accidentally extend when you aren't using it. This sounds great in theory, but when actually pumping you can sometimes feel it trying to catch as you finish each pump. Not really a problem, just a little annoying sometimes.

"Close to perfect: I bought this because I needed a USB 2.0 hub for my laptop and this has the bonus of having a dock for my iPod Nano. It fills both roles very well. I have three issues with it: First, it didn't come with an insert for the second gen Nano so it sort of just floats in there, be careful not to smack it or I'm sure it'll break the connector. Second, the ports on the hub are very close together. Not a deal breaker but mildly annoying. Last, occasionally when coming out of standby mode on my laptop the mouse plugged into the hub isn't recognized. All that's required to fix it is to unplug the hub from the laptop and then plug it back in. Not a big deal unless I'm using my portable hard drive.

"Not so good: Paul Simon is a very skilled songwriter who has done some remarkable work. ""Bookends"" and ""Graceland"" were brilliant, and a number of other songs are classics. But he is also terribly concerned with proving to people how serious he is, and how clever he is, and demonstrating how he can write just about any kind of pop song imaginable. And this can get very, very tiresome, as it does in this album. If there were great tunes here it would be one thing, but there really aren't any here. And lyrically it is extremely overdone. What does he mean by ""I registered to vote today"" in ""Sure Don't Feel Like Love""?

I couldn't conceive that someone intended me to stick my hand into a filthy bag to throw away a diaper. The trap door has a lot of resistance, so you really have to push against the diaper to get it in there.

"Awful Quality: The quality of this DVD is terrible. Anything dark gets completely lost. This makes entire scenes, like the goblin lair and Gollum's cave unwatchable. And it looks like someone was experimenting with do-it-yourself DVD ""special effects"" in the beginning by having the picture randomly rotate 360 degrees and then have a cheesy page turn effect. The sound is not great either, unsurprisingly.Some will argue that this is the only one available now that the better version of the Hobbit DVD is out of print and ridiculously expensive on Amazon and Ebay. And some are willing to excuse this DVD's terrible quality because it was made when the format was brand new in the late 90's.But any and I mean ANY version is better than this.

"Egypt Lives!: A wonderful sequel to 'Temples, Tombs and Hieroglyphs', this book sets aside the well-scrutinized lives of famous pharoahs, and turns instead to the day-to-day life of the rest of Ancient Egypt. Much of the material is new to me, and I found it fascinating reading. Of course, Ms. Mertz could probably make the Boston Phonebook palatable; I would certainly read anything she chose to write. (I firmly believe she hangs out with Elizabeth Peters; Joan Hess occasionally dropping in to make a threesome..)Enough fawning! Read this book! It's interesting!

I have all her CDS, and have seen her live twice. Her last three outings - Room, Christmas, and this CD have been huge disappointments. Diana seems to lack the sparkle she had as Trio and Live in Paris. The band revs up, but she doesn't come along. She is bending her notes like a bad carnival ride at most every turn. Her range is compressed. All in all, a very dissapointing CD with few thrills and a lot of mediocrity. My earlier reviews had compared DK with Ella Fitzgerald and Sarah Vaughn.

"Generally Ineffective: I bought this product with great hopes (thanks to many positive reviews), alas, it does not make a noticable difference in my mosquito and other flying insect problem. I live in northern Virginia, in a relatively built up area and have a small yard, but a horrid biting insect issue. Despite getting rid of standing water pools, over 1 week with the mosquito repellent installed, the MK-15D has not made a worthwhile dent. Friend and family come over and, like me, still get horribly bit in our back yard. We placed the unit close to our patio, but away from other lights and no help. What a shame.

A great topic and era to present this story in, and the cast of characters were unbelievably cool and rich in historical fact, but the ending was a total cliff hanger, which turns away readers like me, who are probably not going to buy the sequel, and the narritive moving from Nell to Pink is alright but the other little tid bits were weird and really confusing, not really necessary in story.

"What a bore...: I had always wanted to see this movie, considering the hype around it. Never got to see it on free TV and wish I had now, so I'd save the money I spent on the video. This film is a bore, to say the least. It seems to be more a tale of sexual license, rather than a expansive drama of a few characters against the backdrop of a revolution. The characters you care little about, ""Lara's Theme"" gets to be grating after a while, the city of Moscow seems to be one street with bleak looking buildings around it and the train ride is tedious. I like Julie Christie, but if you want to see her in a long, romantic drama that has a better score and is much more involving, see ""Far from the Madding Crowd"", from just a few years later after this.

The watch looks just like the picture, except that I would say it is overall darker than the picture shows. The turn dial does occasionally dig into my hand, but it doesn't happen enough to be a burden. My only complaint with the design of the watch is that the clasp on the band comes completely apart, and I would prefer that the two sides stay connected but just loosen. I've worn it for 3 days and have yet to get it wet so I can't attest to the band retaining water, as is mentioned in other reviews.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

I love it, get one!Update, after about 8 months the perc is still going strong. Since I make 8 cups every day (leftovers go into an iced coffee pitcher) the unit tends to need cleaning often. I use Brew-Rite about every two weeks. I do agree with some of the other reviewers that it is kind of hard to see the cup markers on the inside of the pot.

However, I've watched this three times and enjoyed it all three times, especially now that it finally came out on DVD in late 2007. No problems with the transfer, either.I didn't recognize Lee J.

These MC's are definatley in a league of their own and the only comparision I can make is that they sometimes sound similar to The Luniz.

"THIS IS LES CLAYPOOL'S BRAIN ON CRACK: This is the worst Primus album, easily. Herb left the band right after the completion of this atrocity which says a lot about the state of the band. Tales is completely inaccessible(which is good in a way) but only because the music is incomprehensible. Claypool still manages to cram a nice amount of sick bass riffs in here, but the playing is uneven. Some of the tracks meander on for upwards of seven minutes and the lyrics are trademark ridiculous as always. Ler's guitar playing is scattered but brilliant in spots. This is definitely the low point of the Primus catalog. Thank God for Antipop, this is for hardcore Primus completists only.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

"Very disappointed, gone back to scooping.: I bought several of these litter boxes after reading the reviews. If they were well made, they would work well, but they are not. Litter gets in between the pieces making the edges not line up, and litter leaks out when the box is tilted. Also, the grate that separates the clumps from the litter comes unsnapped (and eventually breaks) making it useless. I clean these boxes the old way now- remove the lids and scoop. Great design idea, but they are just too flimsy and cheaply made to work as intended.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

The Head First books are all good at helping one absorb material ... but there may be no other area of software engineering where the approach is needed more.,REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

It was more of a ""what if"" from a fictitious perspective which makes it fiction, not a tool for evangelism like they claim. It was cute, but something just really bugs me about the scriptures not being portrayed accurately. Furthermore, it was boring to me, and I think that anything but a first grader would be bored too. But Jesus is NOT boring, so it must be the movie ;) Additionally, the actor sounded like Ringo Starr which was distracting to me, but he was a terrific actor in this film despite the the distracting accent.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

One thing that surprised me is that half of the book is about the death of Ted Binion and the whole scandal surrounding it. McManus makes the book too personal at times. It's almost like a journal, and although he might care about his own hourly activities, we don't. We also don't care about his family and his children.

I found the behind-the-scenes montage used to accompany Brando's 17-minute reading of ""The Hollow Men"" to be quite creatively done.

"What's the mystery?: [CAUTION--arguably a spoiler in this review] This could have been a really enjoyable book, but instead it was maddening to me. Why would an author title the book ""Marker"" and then not expect the readers to figure out from first chapter that the mysterious deaths were because of markers?? This entirely ruined the aura of mystery to me and made the book frustrating to read. And, as if we're not already unable to put one and one together, the author also begins the very first page with a description of the fertilization of the egg of the heroine, and then drags out her ""revelation"" to herself and the readers that she...hold on to your hats...is pregnant! Who would have guessed! I don't get it. Why would the author pretend to hold out even",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

""Fire Escape"" was up there with the way, ""Better Than It Was"" was decent, and ""Which Way To the Top"" was trying, but, put simply, this CD's only bright side is ""The Way.""

"good introduction to basic character development: The character of Dan Hatch comes accross as a thoughful and responsibile 12-year old. The overall characterization and theme of this book is very didactic (teaches socially and morally accepted lessons). I would prefer that 5th or 6th graders learn more about thought provoking issues. For instance, the characters (espically Dan) avoid realistic discussions and expressing their feelings about death. I mean really, those tornados killed dozens of people.

All of a sudden, The Fountain is on, and once that ends, the album is over! Don't get me wrong; it doesn't matter that the album is just under 40 minutes long. I loved ""Trespass"", and that album was pretty short. However, the difference between ""Trespass"" and ""Nursery Cryme"" is the fact that all six songs on ""Trespass"" were long and beautiful.

I don't try to compare it to Postal Service as some reviewers do, and in all honesty I like this one far better than most of the newer ones. If you are a DCFC fan, your collection will be sadly lacking without this CD. I only gave it 4 stars, because I realize that a good deal of my affection for this album is personal nostalgia.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

It's working fine but not intended for heavy use, ie putting a lot of things on it, etc. I don't think its meant to be straight as we have very little room and did not stand it up in a zig sag line but straight. It looks professional and provides a clean barrier which can't be seen through. All in all, I'm pretty satisfied with it, just wish I had more room for it.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

"fantastic silence: An older film worth watching again. The thing I find fascinating in Witness is Peter Weir's, the director, use of silence. Lengthy secenes where there is no dilalect and yet everything is communicated as clearly as if there were the spoken word.

An awesome movie.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

It's clean, has some good lessons and morals in it, and has elements that appeal both to girls (it's Barbie!) and boys (sword play, fighting, soldiers, etc) -- so what's not to like for parents?! The music videos at the end are fun to watch as well (could've done without the extra on the Barbie Fashion Show though -- what???).

"Fantastic item- highly recommend it for reflux babies!!: I saw this item on a relative's registry and decided to buy one when I was getting ready for our second child. I thought it would be a good way for our three year old to ""admire"" the new baby without having to hold him all the time. It works great for that- but even better for keeping our baby asleep! He is a spitter, and has recently been diagnosed with reflux at just three weeks. A recommendation for reflux babies is to allow them to be at an incline after feedings. This serves that purpose perfectly. It keeps the baby warm and snuggly and helps to stop the spitting up! Only word of warning- make sure the baby is centered in the cushion if sleeping. Our son managed to wriggle over the side a bit.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

I guess it works on fleas and ticks too since she's never had any of those obnoxious parasites either. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is that after application, the fur can be a little matted for a couple of days. Looks kinda weird and can be dangerous to touch if you don't wash your hands right away. Side note: My dog is 68 pounds but I've been using the 55+ lb version of Advantix since she was 50 pounds.

Dexter is an incredible series. The fact that Showtime can put a harder edge on it than network TV could makes a huge difference. The freedom to up the violence, gore, nudity and sex has paid big dividends. HBO and Showtime have quickly become the mecca for anyone looking for quality shows.

Now, I'm getting messages that the color ink is low and to buy a new cartridge soon.It also doesn't print a nice true black, kind of a greenish-black.

"Simply amazing.: Great compositions. The piano is so moving with a beatiful flute and violin to accent the mood. The ocean sounds are gentle and soothing and don't get in the way of the music. If anything they amplify the relaxing quality of the album. As a pianist ... I can say that the pianist behind this music is amazing. He really puts emotion into his music. You feel as though your with him on the ocean shore or on a journey to a magical place filled with beautiful music. I don't want to sound ""cheesy,"" so I'll simply tell you to check it out for yourself. A definite recommendation for any avid fan of new age piano music.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

"The funniest part - Denise Richards trying to act: Were it not for the inclusion of Denise Richards in this movie, I would have enjoyed it a [bit] more. One can usually forgive all the characters that are thrown in a Bond film. But I cannot stress enough the unbearable scenes in which Denise Richards opens her pie-hole; as if reading straight from the script with no feeling. She wrecked the entire film.Not one of the best Pierce Brosnan Bond movies. Especially with the goofy story line of the wacko Renard, who doesn't feel pain.

The novel, in three parts, allows each character a chance to relate his and her take on this life-long three-way love affair.

Virtual Insanity and Cosmic Girl are instantly likable, cheery numbers. Use the Force is a bit on the silly side for me, but things pick up for the next few tracks.

There are a myriad of ways to showcase them: from individual frames to wall tack, or like I did with twine and clothes pins (giving it a whimsical feel). My sister stuck hers to the wall and used colored yarn to twist between each card for decorative flair and flow.3. The multiple images on each card make them very educational.

Add some big names into the mix and an acclaimed director and guess what, the movie fails. The Rock, plainly based on the world's fate or San Francsico for that matter, it just about a bunch of guys trying to evade the green rocks from exploding and causing mass chaos and nucleur reactivity.I admire Nicolas Cage and Sean Connery because their acting can sometimes be of higher class (Adaptation, From Russia with Love), but acting in a thriller with the worst storyline of the 90s changed my mind of watching big names in summer action blockbusters.

After the initial introductive techniques there is little else for her to really say.

I started to watch the first episode around 8:00 p.m. on a Friday night and I was hooked and ended up watching all 13 episodes until about 6:00 a.m. I am now a fan and I can't wait for Season two. In my opinion this is the best teenage TV series of all time. It triggered nearly every emotion in me as I quickly became familar with each of the characters.

So I thought I'd judge the rest of the tracks on the very short album which for some reason still sounds too short with the 2 bonus tracks added. I have to say that this album hasn't aged well at all and the sound quality is poor. Given the standard of recording that's out there today, if you want to do your stereo or even your eardrums any justice, I'd say pass on this until they remaster it; if they ever do.

My toddler is a button pusher and the screen was great in limiting her ability to turn the player on and off. The sound was great, too.

"Great features, quality, and performance for the price: Well, the output from this amplifier sounds comparable to another fairly high-end unit I have, so that is good. It's a well balanced sound with no notable features (I'm not into megabass).Two other positives.First, it can drive A and B speakers simultaneously (or one at a time). But the great advantage is that they are driven independently: turning on the B speakers creates no dip in the volume of the A speakers, and vice versa - even with the very different speakers and cable lengths that I use on A and B. Not something you see every day.Second, it has robust quality.

Rereading this after a few years have passed, I now realize this is a masterpiece of style and characterizations. Unlike most books for kids, it doesn't condescend, and unlike a lot of Victorian style writing (in my opinion anyways), it doesn't have huge pretense. People are bugged by the fact that the animals are highly human, but I think that's part of the point.

The book is dull; Kirks style is uninviting. He keeps repeating the same slogans over and over again: religion is the basis of all society, there must be order and the left is demolishing the world. I advise you just to read the introduction with its famous canon of conservative tought. That will do. Kirk is only interested in explaining his own philosophy and that's why every conservative seems the same in this book. Take for example Edmund Burke. No word about the liberal part of his political philosophy or the inconsistency between his common sense epistemology and his",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

For the cost though compared to the amount you get, I found this product to be worth the purchase. I ended up cutting small pieces of the 3M double sided foam tape stuff which was a great decision.

"Miss Sara the Perfect: I loved Sabrina Jefferies 'Spinster' books, so I thought I'd give this one a try. Well rated, pirates and the high seas? The premises was too good to be true! And oh sweet merciful God it was. Horn was the epitome of arrogance and condescension, and Sara was one of the most uncoperative females ever. The worst part of the book was how both the heroine and hero invalidated everyone else' feelings and choices. Naturally, Sara is the only one who knows how relationships work, and marriage to a former pirate on an island paradise is SO much worse than a sentence to New South Wales, and of COURSE Horn knows everything about how Sara feels or wants or believes and it's up to him to make her stop lying to herself.It took me almost two month",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

"Terrible!: I was excited after seeing all the positive reviews, but I was very disappointed upon actually doing the DVD. I am 25 with no knee problems and I work out 6x/week. This DVD KILLED my knees (in the first ten minutes no less!). Plus its extremely BORING!

"No suspense, too many characters: I genuinely like Jane Haddam, but she should have listened to fate when her computer crashed and she retrieved this manuscript only with hi-tech intervention. It took fifty pages before Gergor Demarkian made an appearance--and in those pages one character after another was introduced. The narrative meadered without direction through most of the book. There were tons of social commentary and almost no plot. This novel may be more literary than mystery, but even so, it was very slow going. In fact, it ground to a halt for me many times. I feel it was her least successful effort to date. I hope the author uses some careful plot development next time and focuses on Demarkian.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

So why does doesn't this recording do that? One can only wonder! Music was published in 16th century Italy in a convenient way but we know that larger forces were used when it was performed.The playing and singing on this disc is excellent and the instrumental works are particularly good.

The entire cd (with the exception of ""Boom, Like That"") is mellow to the point of it being boring, with no sign of Knopfler's signature guitar work. I bought this cd based on the Amazon review that said this was Knopfler's ""most rocking album since his days in Dire Straits"". What were they listening to? This is untrue and misleading.

It's clear that director John Boorman was more interested in the technical aspects of the film, such as the special effects, and therefore left the actors to their own devices. Ellen Burstyn wisely chose to skip this movie, and the Exorcist III actually ignores this film, picking up from the first one. This movie simply isn't scary, but the actors react as if they're in a thriller, which makes the movie slightly comical. This movie is so bad, it's not even good in a 'bad' way, and yet many folks have given this movie 4 or 5 stars on this board. Perhaps the demon Pezuzu is at work again!",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

"HORNER'S BEST: Ask anyone and they'll tell you---TITANIC has some of the most beautifully written music ever. No wonder James Horner's score won award after award. Simply put, the music is heart-wrenching, emotional, passionate, and breathtaking all at the same time. Just close your eyes and visualize yourself back in time --- in an innocent, more naive period of time. It's hard to select a favorite, but I'm quite sure you'll agree that ""Rose"" is one of the most amazing pieces of music ever composed. Also included is Celine Dion singing that all-too-familiar epic ballad, ""My Heart Will Go On"". Pick up this astonishing soundtrack to a spectacular film.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

So (since I didn't have a model during my own childhood) I wanted to know how to introduce my own kids to faith at home. I was really looking for more of a ""how to"" guide than this book provided. Plus, unlike the author's, my childhood was great! I grew up in a stable and supportive environment. The only thing lacking was exposure to Christianity. So, since I didn't come from a bad or dysfunctional home, I had a hard time relating to the author's own struggles. Plus, I am reluctant to discount many of the values I learned as a kid.

At least in satanic rites you get the wonderful portentious intonements of Peter cushing ""this evil is more addictive than heroin"" ""this plague is more virulent than the black death"" etc etc, wonderful, especially his explanation of how Earth is destined for an imminent catastrophe ""where the circles meet"".

Once I saw on the bottom of the screen that he had an album out, I knew I had to get it. His voice is so unique that its insane. It's nice to hear a singer who isn't like all of the American Idol type voices out there. This type of music wouldnt usually be something that I would listen to, but Michael Mcdonald has changed all of that with this amazing album.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

The one redeeming song is ""grace is gone,"" which was sweetened up a bit from the original.

"Biography? History? Memory Improvement?: Jonathan D. Spence has written a book which can fall into a number of categories. On one level, it is a biography of a Jesuit who worked as a missionary in China during the Post-Reformation period. On another, it is an examination of his remarkable memory. On yet another, it vividly describes the China of this era and the efforts to bring Christianity to this closed society. The structure of the book is unusual for the genre, but is surprisingly successful. Ultimately, the book becomes a sort of psycho-historical account of a most remarkable man in a most remarkable place in a most remarkable time. Images from this book will linger in your mind for some time to come. Recommended for those interested in religious his",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

"Lost in the darkness: If you like entertaining stories, you will hate this one. Conrad is continually dark and depressing. In many cases, he makes the story disturbing. The narrator (Marlow) rambles on about his venture into the Congo to unwilling listeners. Conrad uses so much ambiguous language it is almost difficult to grasp the story itself. The wording and language the novella uses, in a way, creates a feeling of confusion for the reader. The number of adjectives thrown into a sentence tends to take the readers attention away from the story. However, the plot is somewhat interesting, if you can get around the style of language used throughout the rest of the story.

They are not commercially oriented like Balls to the Wall and Metal Heart, something that definitely alienates some fans that still longing the mid-80s metal scene.Playing at its best, this live album demonstrates how an incredibly good band Accept became with the years.

"Great set of an up and down season: Many consider this to be Seinfeld's crowning season.

However, the whole subplot about Jerry and George getting an offer for a TV series was truly a misstep, and really resulted in some of the poorer episodes in this series' nine year history.As for this DVD set, Columbia/Sony has again done an admirable job, both with the transfers and the extras.

I have no idea if this book gets on a coherent thought.

"another reason i love modern european cinema: Besides just simple good film-making, I've figured out WHY European dramatic cinema is better than that found in the U.S.They make more REAL honest movies about human behavior. Whereas in the U.S, a great percentage of films are juvenile comedies, trash pop culture flicks or shallow horror movies. The more you make the more likely you're able to turn out quality- and this film from Spain is no exception.My Spanish cinema experiences are few, but I've enjoyed what I've seen... one of which being the wonderfully creepy movie: ""The Devil's Backbone""so, go order this or buy it, turn the lights down, pour your drink, and get comfy for a good quality movie...and hey, it's one of Penelope Cruz's first movies!",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

Everything sound less tinny. It's not like an entirely new recording, but they have done a remarkable job considering the material with which they had to work. Whether or not this the best early compilation I won't argue: it is what it is (and I think it's pretty good).

First off, the magic section makes very little sense with regards to the drain and mana system, and the aspected magician isn't explained at all. Secondly, the Matrix uses overcomplicated rules for even simple tasks. The technical jargon used was quite confusing.

Has thumbing their noses at millions of cinephiles who want the option, for varied reasons, of turning on English subtitles or closed captions now become standard operating procedure at Olive Films?

A Clockwork Orange achieves what no other film has ever done and that's to get as close as possible to telling a story in a motion picture entirely in the subjective first person point of view. Now whether it achieved it or not, is not the point here. What is the point is that Kubrick succeeded in gracing us with a cinematic point of view so intimate and subjective to the main character, that all else really doesn't matter. Through a cinematic view point, A Clockwork Orange is simply a Masterpiece.

I'll always be a big fan of the film but not satisfied with blu ray: The problem is that the subtitles are not really a good translation compared to the subtitle use in the fox lorber version that I have. The video quality is not at all bad but I was hoping for a clean picture detail and it just feels like they just grab a VHS and put it on the Blu ray. They could've done more considering that this movie is an action movie favorite. Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez drew the most inspiration from this film obviously.,REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

"TRANSCENDS MERE WORDS - INDESCRIBABLE: I'm still speechless from this film, so I won't begin to attempt to put into words the emotion and awe that it will inspire in all but the coldest of hearts.

"Very Out-of-date in most respects: It is interesting to read the ""Terminator-esque"" fears of 19th century scholar/writers like Butler. Unfortunately, in the face of today's depleted oil supplies, such fears of machines taking over society may be a bit out of date. At any rate, what surely is out of date is Butler's writing style, which is all ""tell"" and no ""show""--the complete opposite of, and in this case vastly inferior to, the Hemingway style of the 20th century. There is only a thin veneer of story here, a thin and slight excuse of a story and then Butler hits us with page after page of philosophical dystopian diatribe. Orwell may have learned a lot from this book which helped him write the masterpiece ""1984"", but Orwell did it much, much better. Orwel",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

"An indescribable joy...: Nietzsche called NFU an ""indescribable joy"", saying Dostoevsky is ""the only pyschologist whom he ever learned anything from."" It may seem paradoxical that you can derive joy out of such an unremittingly tragic book, but any astute reader interested in the human heart would have to agree with Nietzsche. Certainly one of the most profound and revolutionary works in literature, the keynote to existentialism, and modernity. There was simply nothing like this book in literature before it came along( of course there were works similiar to it afterwards, since it was so influential, e.g., Ellison's homage to NFU ""Invisible Man"").Dostoevsky's prescience blooms in this work, as this work foreshadows the fractured nature of the modern world.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

They are washable, almost impossible to ruin (with normal use), and they feel brand new for a long, long, long time. Once you use these cards you will never go back to regular decks.

"Disturbing and in a very sad way, kind of pathetic: This film is an aimless story about a guy recently disowned by his family. Sadly, that's the only thing about the character that inspires sympathy. The one facet in which this movie succeeds is showing a young guy with absolutely no self respect and his series of increasingly dangerous and drug addled trysts while he plans to kill himself on Christmas eve.

John Cleese, himself, was unable to save this picture, that is how bad it is. What is unfunny about it? Everything. I don't know who the planned audience for this disaster was supposed to be, but I can't think of any part of the world population who would think this film was even mildly amusing. The more serious storyline, if you can even call it that, makes very little sense and doesn't bring the notability or the value of this project up either.

To ensure that it stays operational, I've added superglue to make sure the glass does not shift out the millimeter or two that seems to kill the flashlight. Still decided to give it 4 stars because for the price it does give out decent light to use on camping trips, and battery life has been good though I have not timed it.

The biographies themselves are no better than what you would find in an encyclopedia and contain absolutely no new or novel information.

"1979 Period Piece: Definitely a period piece, it is worth a revisit 31 years later for several reasons. First, it gave Meryl Streep her first Oscar (as a ""Supporting"" Actress, so don't expect to see a lot of her). Second, it's an interesting look at what socially was probably ground-breaking gender-bending in 1979: the question of whether the best ""mom"" for a child caught in divorce could be the dad. And third, the young son caught between his parents is simply adorable!What I like about this film is its realism.

"A decline in talent........: This cd starts off with the worst song The Get Up Kids have ever written. Oddly enough, this cd shows how The Get Up Kids have gotten significantly worse over time. Since when do unpassionate singing and pianos have a place in rock. (Nobody can call this emo either because it is not) The only reason I would recommend this cd is for the last six songs. Everything else on this cd is a pathetic attempt at giving high school kids some kind of motivation. They will think to themselves, wow, girls don't like me, and one day I will could be able to write terrible sappy songs about it and make loads of money.

That makes him 39"" tall. With the backrest on the lowest setting or closest to petals, his feet barely touches the petals with his legs fully extended and can't pedal bike. If he were to pedal the bike straight he will need an additional 3 inches in LEG length not 3 inches in overall height. Also when you turn the bike the pedal on the outside of turn moves even further away so he now needs an additional 3 to 6 inches of leg length to reach pedal.

"Starts strong and falls apart: Anil is an interesting woman, and for the majority of the book, we follow her journey back to a Sri Lankan home that's recognizable, yet in some ways shockingly alien. Anil is intropective, but surprisingly numb. She seems disassociated from herself and her feelings.Suddenly, the book turns into a heavy handed political statement. Anil is lost as the author takes the cheap and easy route to make a rather banal point, which just kills any legitimate emotional involvement. It's as if the first part of the book is something literary and interesting, while the ending goes for the simple sell.Do not waste your time reading this dissappointment.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

We both found the conversations to be mostly overly verbose and insignificant to moving the story along. There isn't anything in it that would be against traditional family values. The reason we watched it is because the daughter was eighteen years old, and I'm working on a book on movies about kids. I'd say the best that could be said of this movie is that it does give the feeling of being the 'third wheel' or the 'odd woman out.'

Alasdair Mac Colla emerges from these pages looking super-human, but certainly not heroic in the conventional sense.

I thought it might not have mattered, but on the last song of the CD, my player goes nuts skipping all over the last recording. I tried to clean the prints, but they won't come off, and I think that using anything short of some really caustic chemicals which would damage the rest of the CD will not take these prints off of it.

The first one I ordered lasted about 9 months until it just shorted out. I got a second one which lasted about a month, and again, it just shorted out. Part of it has to do with static electricity generated in the winter time in my house, so when I go to touch it, I shock it, thus making it short out. Luckily the price is reasonable, so I'm not out a ton of money. I will NOT be buying a third and will either buy shorter lamps or learn to stretch if I need to turn on my lamp.

"A Great Find: I am in love with an appliance! My Farberware pressure cooker is the best appliance in my kitchen (short of my dishwasher, of course). This one does it all, making pressure cooking virtually effortless.

"Pales in comparison to the Truman Show: This movie starts out kinda slow and boring. So stick with it if you want it to make sense. It gets better, but I wouldn't get my hopes up too high.The movie is too serious to be very funny, and too silly to be taken seriously. The story starts in the middle and catches back up with itself in a somewhat unique way, but that's probably the most interesting part. If you like movies that feature loose sexual morality, then you might enjoy it, but it's really a slow paced movie.Eternal Sunshine replaces The Cable Guy as my least favorite Jim Carey movie. I really think Carey is a great actor, but I thought he was too old for this role.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

I'm always aware that Robbins is grinning there behind the typewriter, and I'm there grinning with him. With Haskett, I was less aware of the writer and more aware of the writing. Take your pick. Anyway. I completely enjoyed this book and was sad and disappointed, not by the ending, but because it ended so too quickly.

"Heavy and unwieldy: A small push mower should be just the ticket for small manageable yards. This model, however, is far heavier than it needs to be and is difficult to maneuver in tight corners. It also tends to do wheelies when backing up, gouging the lawn with the catcher clips and dumping the catcher contents everywhere.To its credit, the bearings and the blades seem very rust resistant. If you like to mow in the rain or you're one to forget your tools outside, you may want to give this one some thought.I retired this model after its first summer, picked up a neolithic push mower at a neighbor's garage sale, and am far more satisfied.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE
"I still love this album!: Heather Headley's big hit from this album was I Wish I Wasn't, but the rest of the album is just as dynamite. I love the several funky numbers such as He Is! The ballads are fabulous! I love that one song where she tells this young girl to get her act together. Few Broadway singers can step off that stage and make a phenomenal album like Heather did. She gives some R&B female artists Faith Evans, Monica, Alicia Keys, and some others a run for their money here! Such fabulous vocals on every song! She even has a song now on the Diary of A Mad Black Woman soundtrack, so she's not finished yet. Hope that Heather makes some more exciting and soulful albums such as this!",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

The dedication to Fairstein seems like a forced nicety. I find it most disturbing that a character in a novel should be lifted both from a real living person and her alter ego in novels.

"Easily curable: The plague known as bad breath facing this country is easily tamed with Altoids latest blockbuster release: the cinnamon strip. Just place a few of these red hot bacteria busters on your tongue and prepare yourself to embark on a wild ride full of plot twists and near-death experiences. The 32 strips contained in this package should last at least a week, but I suck these down faster than my cigarettes, and usually burn through 2 tins a day.Equally as enjoyable on hot summer evenings and cold winter mornings alike, Altoids delivers with the punctuality of a 16 year old kid on his first job interview.

It deals with the tension between the British and the native Indians of India, as well as with the tension between the Hindus and the Muslims. It also deals with the mystical in its portrayal of characters in search of the infinite and eternal. The book is divided into three sections which correspond with the seasons of the Indian year - the Cold Weather, the Hot Weather and the Rains. Each section of the book is dominated by each of the seasons. Each section also focuses on one of the three ethnic groups found in India during this time (1920's). They are Muslim, Anglo-Indian and Hindu. This is a very deep book, that has to be read at least a couple of times in order for the reader",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

Of course, Sean Condon still remains a goofball and one can only look forward to his next works to come....especially 'Film', a book out in the UK but still being anxiously awaited her in the U.S.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

This film was particularly interesting to me as I was raised in the home of a fundamentalist protestant minister, not unlike the two sisters in this film. After running from such belief systems in my 20s, studying buddhism in my early 30s and then watching this film -- well...just watch it. I would encourage those of us in the West(ern hemisphere) who were raised in Christian homes and later found Zen to watch this film as it illustrates the beauty of both systems and how they are somehow married...",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

"Baraka Collector's Edition Review: Baraka is most definitely a film without barriers, cultural or religious, it shows the human being in his/her purest form. The film has no words and yet it tells us a story that a million words could not tell us in a lifetime. The visuals and the sounds bring out our deepest dreams, emotions and imaginations. Baraka brings us back to our primordial senses and creates a universal love, understanding and compassion towards ourselves, our planet and its never-ending beauty.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE
"Fair to Midland: Found this watch to have cool features and easy to setup. Easy to use.Only problem is the information it gives was not always right! Altitude was close but varied from 30' to 170' OFF. Barometer was never right and calibrated correctly. maybe works better staying outside. Commercial buildings are pressurized, could be the issue??? Temp was as instructed, must be removed from wrist for several minutes to get ambient temperature; that was accurate. Compass was jerky and hard to settle down, not fluid-like movement but accurate outside. Compass was also too sensitive, would not work near metal i.e. in the vehicle or aircraft, near other electronics.

"The Decline and Fall of the Holywood Romance: Who is everyone kidding? There are no heart-felt feelings, no deep stirrings of the human soul. The lack of true romance is best demonstrated when Evert arrives in Chicago and he has a conversation with Roberts. The question comes up - did he come see her for a ""quick f__k"". (And this movie is rated PG-13???) Kids in junior high have more intelligence than this. The movie is just vapid Hollywood nonsense. If you want a great Hollywood romance, try ""The Awful Truth"" or ""It Happened One Night"". Both of these movies were made long before I was born, but have enduring qualities.

I would suggest that he write porn instead, but even the sex scenes in the book are unrewarding, unerotic and unarousing. On the plus side, the guy on the cover is quite tasty and fortunately legal. Someone should just put together a coffee table book of covers of gay novels. I am sure that it would be more stimulating than a great deal of the novels themselves.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

"Pretentious failure, unfortunately: It is not difficult to understand why Tom Russell would try to pull off something like this. It is an ambitious synthesis of many of the influences and traditions that has been part of his earlier work, this time moving even further towards bohemian litterature and poetry. Unfortunately it does not even come close to deliver on its ambition. The result is a pretentious and affected collection of ideas that are mostly form rather than content, effect rather than emotion. It is understandable that he wants to move on, but this was a step in the wrong direction and he really did not pull it off. It is an embarrasment to listen to - unfortunately.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

Great insight into other aspects of clan life.: This book is great in that it gives you more insight into how the clanners live.

"What A Fraud: My rating is based on the fact that the music is decent at best, consist of a strange mixture of artists, and I feel cheated that none of the artists were in the studio with The Chairman. One reviewer wrote, ""The way Bono sings this one with Frank brings new life to this classic."" Well, it's simply not true that they were ""with"" each other. I know of no other duets recording where the star lays down the tracks and the guest artists come along and sing to the tapes afterwards. In addition, Frank's voice simply in not up to par with his earlier recordings. I'm 35 and I love Frank Sinatra but I have to objectively say that this is one to pass on.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

"Somewhat exagerated: I think when writing a book of this type there is always a tendency to exagerate facts and figures in order to make it more dramatic and sell more copies. One case in point: the author says that the 3,000 figure for Jews killed in Zagare is more likely 7,000. Where does she get this figure? According to census records, in 1938 Zagare had 5445 residents, not all Jews. In 1942 it had 2,936 residents, mostly non-Jews. So about 2,509 were killed, not 7,000, perhaps not even 3,000. This of course does not make the crime any less horrendous. But let's stick to facts, please.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

"Makes you think...: I saw this movie because I was a huge fan of the band ""They Might Be Giants."" I must say I was awestruck at the end. It was very powerful and somewhat disturbing. The romantic elements weren't there too much, but the acting was superb and humourous. I heard about the cut-out scene from the supermarket without which the movie made no sense, but I think that the most crucial scene is the scene in the taxi when Gearge C.

It's entertaining and interesting and left me turning page after page, not putting the book down. Anyone who would like a good, interesting book should check this out.

"Does not keep coffee hot: I bought this carafe style coffee maker because I thought it would better suite my habit of drinking 2-4 cups over a 3-4 hour period. Initially the coffe is about 150-160 degrees. Within 60 minutes it is about 120 degrees. The warming burner kicks off 17 minutes after the brew cycle is started. I have found that turning the burner back on does little to keep the coffee warm. You can, literally, place your hand on the burner while it is on and not get a burn. If you are just after that first cup of coffee this may be a good buy. I would assume this is not the case if you are looking for a carafe style maker.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

The songs all have lyrics by David Lynch, with music by Angelo Badalamenti. The first thing you are likely to notice about the songs is that the words don't rhyme. That's pretty unusual, but somehow it works anyway. All the songs are love songs, by the way.

The only complaint I have is that the wires seem a little flimsy, and when you move around a lot they make a thud noise in the buds. I resolved this problem by running them by wearing them upside down in my ears, then ran the wire up the front of my ears, then behind my ears, and then to a spot on the back of my head (where I taped the two wires together so they st",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

Massive Attack have a lot of variety in their textures, beats, and vocals, something you can't always say about Portishead. In addition, not all the songs are about pathos, which makes them better for general listening (and surprisingly, driving music). The selective use of electric guitars definitely (not definately!) enhances the music. Every single track on this album is good; the only faults are possibly #'s 5 and 11, which are a little dull.

"Wrong about salt, what else is wrong?: On page 335 the book asserts ""Salt produced by the evaporation of sea-water in hot countries is said sometimes to lose its saline properties.""This isn't actually true.

When I wasn't sure if, for example, my VP broth had really changed color enough to be a positive result, the large glossy pictures were nice. However, when I was trying to figure out colonial morphology, only about half the terms that we were supposed to know were covered in the book. Not so helpful.

Bored with his respectable existence, he has fun and takes solace in a holiday outside of his behavioral norms. He has middle aged man thoughts- about his wife and a younger attractive ghost woman, that are realistic (to the extent of the propriety of the author) and enlightening. A true triumph of the work, however, is that it does this without becoming so maudlin that it is suitable for an English class.Finally, it is a comedic book, that is entertaining",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

Nevertheless, this book had real meaning: it was outstandingly interesting. Knowles effectively managed to wield the English language to create a wonderful prose and an ingenius parable. Read this book, it will really surprise you (and, many books I have read I found to be boring and predictable--this was not one of them).",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

It contains essays by known Montgomery scholars such as Epperly, Gammel, Rubio, and Waterston tha examine closely the author's examples of life writing so as to shed light on the private side of this enigmatic lady. The book also includes a secret diary penned jointly by Montgomery and her friend, Nora Lefurgey, during the period of January 1903 to June 1903. This diary shows the humourous, fun, and playful side of Montgomery as the two women recount some of tales of their schemes and flirtations.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE
"You've got to be kidding.: When I'm told that Jemima is GROSSLY overweight (""At least 100 pounds!!""), and basically spends all of her time fondling her mountains of flab and stuffing bacon into her hole, and not being able to walk a few feet without stopping for a breath, I figured that she had to be over 300. How surprised was I to find out that she was supposed to be 217. Add to my overall astonishment and horror the fact that she lost 80 pounds in three months, with only one passing comment from the author about how unhealthy it is to crash diet and work out obsessively. The message is clear. Fat is bad. Skinny is good, no matter how you get there. Good job, Jane Green. You're obviously a much smarter woman than I, a simple American.

She's against circumcisions. She's against C-sections. She thinks mothers should take their twins to the doctor's separately (what??), etc., etc..

One of 6 sanders I own!!: I will now be able to put the other 5 sanders away.I have 2 belt sanders that will go though stock a bit faster but are much more difficult to control and with just one false move severe damage is the result. While the 7336 is just a bit slower it is a breeze to control. A big feature for me was the veritable speed as different wood requires different settings to maximize stock removal. I have not only been impressed with its ability to remove stock but also to put a glass finish on a surface. The hard maple dresser that I recently completed was the first test for a smooth finish and the 7336 scored a perfect 5 in my book. I would recommend this sander to everyone looking to purchase only one sander.,REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE
"Real crime was great, but horror is just ... horrible: How one Earth could Mr Harris hope to follow his two earlier successes? The serial killer theme, which he reached ahead of every one else, was a popular literary gold mine. Such new material does not come along every day, or even every decade. So Harris stuck to his guns and, after years of pacing up and down, churned out more of the same - except that it wasn't the same. RED DRAGON and SILENCE were based on real cases. That was what made them so startling. And it excused the horror, because it we knew these things had really happened. In this book Harris spirals off into pure horror fantasy. No real cases this time, just the author's imaginings pushed to the limit of nastiness. The result is a pale sh",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

"Better alternatives for the same price!: According to Antennaweb, I live about 20 miles from the transmitters, here ourside Boston. I got the Silver Sensor antenna to go with the DVICO Gold-T tuner card for my PC. Of the 7 or 8 stations I ought to be able to pick up, I could only get 4. I live in a two-story house and couldn't get consistent reception anywhere; the signal strength would flake in and out. The I read about a cheap UHF antenna (model 15-2160) at RadioShack and gave it a try. I can now get all 8 stations without fiddling with the direction and all that.

"Never a Dull Moment!: When I first heard about this movie, I have to admit it intrigued me, however I was really skeptical that another Vampire could possibly keep my attention, however, I was dead wrong! Never during this movie was I bored. The action was surprising entertaining, and the film was shot beautifully (I LOVE the lighting!). The theme is also something I've never seen dealt with prior to this movie. 'Underworld' is by far my new favorite movie, & I have absolutely no regrets of purchasing this film without viewing it first in theatres. I anticipate a sequel, although I hope it doesn't follow the cliche and make a sequel that totally does the original no justice.

"Crass, Loud, Rude, Vulgar, Insulting and Just Plain Foolish: In addition to being a complete waste of time, money, effort (or lack thereof) and resources, this film did not deserve to be made. So many struggling actors, directors, writers that are out there that spin yarns more enjoyable in their sleep, and yet, Hollywood green-lights these ridiculous movies that degrade humanity and set us back as a people. We need to reject these movies and begin supporting smaller features with more heart and soul.

It was also extremely comfortable. The issue came when I tried to sleep with it on--I sleep on my sides. The mask is too thick, and sleeping on my side caused a ""lump"" where the thickness of the mask came into play.

You have to have at least 5 people. Also, you hardly get anything for the amount of money you spend -- you get a tiny box, and the only contents are a stack of cards and one fold-out page of instructions.The cards only serve to let players know what role they play (villager, cult member, seer, etc.) You could easily just write the roles on pieces of paper. The rules are incredibly simple (they fit on a single small piece of paper), so that gameplay is very limited.Honestly, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.

The story draws you in, and her quirky characters and unique style adds to it. True, ""Beauty and the Vampire"" has been done before, but never quite like this. This vampire isn't bad-boy or sexy, at least not in the traditional way. This romance isn't anything out of fairy tales, that's for sure.So yes, it takes some getting used to. But if you've read McKinley before you'll recognize her style, and of course, her uniqueness. In the",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE
"emits odor, but doesn't attract: Had purchased the trap in 2010 at hardware store. Looking for the refill cartridge, found it with good price on Amazon and purchased last year. Noticed that this product emits a strong odor, so felt that it was fresh enough. BUT didn't attract any yellow jackets. Reread the hints on the insert paper from the original trap and decided to try a half slice of deli ham. The ham immediately attracted and the yellow jackets were trapped.

"Not as good as other Splinter Cells: The problem with this game is that UBIsoft forgot what made Splinter cell so fun. Namely, you had two dissimilar teams (a spy and a mercenary). Each team had strengths and weaknesses. Double Agent took all that away.This game is no better than a shoot em up game. There is no strategy involved anymore. UBIsoft should have just taken their earlier offering ""Splinter Cell:Chaos Theory"" and done some minor tweeks, like making a 8 person multiplayer (vs the current 4).I returned Double Agent a week after I bought it. Don't waste your time on Double Agent. If you want a shoot em up game, get Rainbow 6, or Call of Duty. If you want a great stealthy, strategy game, buy Chaos Theory.

They died, all right, in all kinds of imaginative ways.I was curious to see how well a music composer did as a villain. Richard Myles did a great job. He makes one creepy, yet sympathetic monster. If bad things hadn't happened to his character, if he hadn't been left on his own, would he have become such a creature? Or was he doomed from the start to become an instrument of revenge, because of a secret I won't divulge? And is he really the monster? Or is the monster the woman who wants to turn the junkyard into something else for her own profit?No spoilers here. Just let me say",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

So you can't get your news subscriptions, download books, etc. That is a HUGE mistake--it lets out most international travelers, and that is the prime use I would want to have with the Kindle or any other such device.

So I wrote a lot of programs, and learned a lot, but I still would not recommend this to those who don't have a nearly university-level math background.

On one of the cuts, ""After Hours,"" McDuff switches to piano, but most of the cuts are organ quartet/quintet-type arrangements.

"Fun game but patience required.: This game is a solid overall RPG but is a little buggy. I've seen some bad reviews but the game does not deserve some of the poor reviews it has received. The game is loads of fun with good character development and an interesting story line. The primary frustration comes because there are so many places where you have to accomplish certain tasks in order to proceed to a new area or new level in the game. In addition, the lack of a good map or journal in the game means you are lost a good portion of the time. The first person fighting is great and as you develop your character their are many ways to fight the numerous different types of enemies you encounter.

"Good game but could be better: This is a solid RTS game. However it simply copies too much from AGE OF EMPIRES. I Like AOE but there are times when your playing the game and you will be thinking, 'Man they didn't change anything'. Contrary to popular belief the graphics are good. The different races they have are intersting, especially for a STAR WARS fan. However, there is one serious problem that also affected AOE. The problem is the races don't vary enough for long term playabilty. Sure they tweek the races here and there so that one may gather a certain resource faster or one has better pilots, but there is no real difference in the various troops from race to race.

"Denzel is great, the story is terrible.: This COULD have been an interesting exploration of ethics, race, and the war on drugs. Instead you get a very miscast Ethan Hawke (who still does a good job) as an unbelievably naive cop, and excellent performance from Denzel that is nevertheless one-note evil. You could walk away from this movie thinking that Black and Hispanic people are violent and evil and that white people are either highly moral, or if they are corrupt, at least not murderers. I don't like that message. This movie also has one of the WORST ways to save a hero I have ever seen: the old coincidence at the last minute. Trust me, this alone ruins the film.

Perhaps this is due to the youth of the characters. They'd be an excellent way to introduce your kids to Anne's books, but are a bit childish for an adult or older teen.

I found it only slightly easier, with no real improvement. I believe that the problem stems from something that Douglas Adams had once said: ""I'm trying to be literate, not literary.""

"our answer to James Bond: I became obsessed with finding this film, along with its sequel, after seeing the second Austin Powers. As a huge James Bond fan, I found Derek Flint and his ultra-cool approach to saving the world very entertaining. James Coburn is perfect in this role. He has more gadgets than Q could ever think up, he has four beautiful women living with him, and he can save the world without even trying. Overall, this film was a very amusing satire of the 007 series, and a must for any Austin Powers fan",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

"Go Ad Fontes (back to the sources): Matchbox Twenty's Yourself or Someone Like You was quite possibly one of the best albums ever. Many great hits such as ""Push"", ""3a.m."", and ""Real World"" were greatly accepted by the radio. Other songs on the album, while not so popular, also caught the appeal of Matchbox Twenty lovers. The imagery and creative thought provoking lyrics were incredible as well as the new sound that they were played in. Things were going great for Matchbox Twenty untill they decided to change their style and go with more of a pop sound. This is where they released their sell-out album Mad Season. A few of the songs on this album were similar to the previous sound but the overall effect of the CD was not nearly as capturing as Yourself or So",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

"Good for the basics: A good primer on HTML and web publishing in general, if you don't want to get too deep. The tags are laid out clearly, and the methods to achieve certain looks or feels are plainly illustrated, but the book doesn't teach that much theory, so you are generally stuck with the methods they teach. Some of the methods are somewhat non-standard, which worries me, but as a whole the book is sound and easy to read. I would recommend _HTML 4 for the Worldwide Web_, by Elizabeth Castro, instead. It is very clear and basic, but it covers more of the theory so you can be a more powerful designer.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

"too long--unfocused: A 500+ page book is a huge commitment of time. I had this book on my bookshelf for years, and decided to finally read it. It started strong but lost its way mid-way. Because I was over 200 pages into it, I decided to keep reading. It was a slow read. The portions of the book that related to the Irish Potato Famine were enthralling. However, I found the protagonist to be poorly drawn and her behavior inexplicable--the text never really delved into what made her tick. In the end I came away with the feeling that this book could have used a good editor who would have helped the author decide on her focus and then edit the text down to its appropriate length.

No Need to Spend over $20: People if you are spending more than $20 for a 6 foot HDMI cable you are spending too much. Remember it's a digital transfer. This is nothing more than a really fat USB cable and those are a dime a dozen. No need for fancy gold plated ends and super fancy shielding to protect against signal loss. It's just Ones and Zeros. The signal is either their or it's not. Don't be fooled by those who have made a fortune off of the analog cable business. The rules that guide analog signals don't realy apply to digital. Bigger is not better in the digital world and more expensive does not equal higher quality. This is the 3rd set of this brand of cable that I have bought and I have not had any issues.,REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

Unfortunately, this causes the album to sound like a poorly produced demo. It must be noted that Gary's primary instrument is the guitar, which he plays very well. However, this some what limits him in his arrangements. Gary is forced to fill the tracks with a cheap sounding synthesizer/keyboard. This is unfortunate due the sterile and motionless feel of the instrument which sounds like midi computer music. His voice is beautiful and powerful, as it never fails to soar. His song writing on the album is genius. He is a true talent. If you wish to enjoy this fully, I would recommend one of his previous, professionally produced alb",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

Consider Botkin's book a whirlwind tour. Although I believe every American should be exposed to these narratives (above and beyond the historical representations from textbooks), the stories in Lay My Burden Down are so powerful, so full of intensity, I gave the book 4 stars because it is almost brutal in its power.

"Not enough story for its size: The good things about this book are Goodkind's crafty use of words, the memorable characters and its readability. However, these strengths are outweighed by the fact that the story moves too slowly as you often find yourself waiting for something of importance to happen. If an author is going to write a book of this length, he or she must be sure to keep the plot moving--Goodkind fails in this respect. Also, Goodkind goes beyond an average level of violence to images and events that are graphic, vile and just plain disgusting. What is worse is that these scenes have little bearing on the plot and just seem to be included for shock value.

Then again, it's hard to make an engaging (pardon the pun) movie with such a ridiculous story line. Pretty Woman was a far far better flick, you can't even compare the two.

"Another NWOBHM could-have-been: I've had the vinyl for the LP, EP and the 7"" single for some time, but it was nice to get it ""all"" in a digital medium. That said, one or two songs in the live set (the LP) wavered a little so I'm guessing this was mastered from a vinyl source. A little harsh on the high end as well.But the music itself........ the live debut LP is a mixed affair, some good, some mediocre to poor. The band themselves expressed their dissatisfaction with it in the CD liner notes. But the 3-track EP and the 7"" single (all bonus tracks) are really good, nice studio production & excellent performances, which is why I titled this ""could-have-been"". If you're a fan of this genre and don't have this, I definitely recommend it just for those 5 track",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

There is no mention of a church, of the sacraments. Instead, the Christian ""worker"" is portrayed as an isolated self-made spiritual giant.

"A Credit To The Genre: If you have been waiting for someone that could breathe some new life back into the singer/songwriter genre that was so prevelant in the 70's, here he is. Your Cat Stevens, Van Morrison, Neil Young, and Jackson Browne albums can all take a well deserved rest.All of the qualities that made those artists so great are here in these songs. Ray's soulful voice is filled with a passion that rivals both those of Cat Stevens and Van Morrison, yet it remains uniquely his own. His guitar playing is rich with melodic rythms that flesh out his thoughtful lyrics. There is also some very nice percussion work here peppered throughout most of the songs.All in all this is a great album and a welcome entry into the genre of the singer/songwriter.

The sounds and visuals are fantastic and overly effective, so much so that it still stays with me even months after seeing the film. This was a great horror movie and one that, because of the scares, I will not have the nerve to even watch again anytime soon. Even the TV ads for it bother me.

On the one hand, it appears that the authors wanted to publish a book of arty fence photographs (and indeed the book includes a number of lush, imaginative shots), while at the same time offering a how-to guide for fence building. Unfortunately, the how-to portion keeps the book from being a bona fide artistic endeavor, while the space and presentation given to artsy fence portraits prevents the book from ever developing into a sufficiently comprehensive building guide. Bottom line: don't expect this book to deliver an adequate lesson in actual fence-building techniques, if you don't have building skills to begin with; but if you just want to look at",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

The dynamics have been squeezed out, and I found myself reaching for the volume knob to turn the 2010 disc *down*--which is a real travesty for such a good-time rock record.

Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed. A lot of the songs remind me of songs on Brandy's ""full moon"" album but even many of them were ""ho-hummish"". Too many of the songs like ""Just a Dance"" or ""Up & Down"" just don't have the ""oomph"" as her other songs. They all sound like a million other things I've heard on the radio with very little to differentiate.""Play your part"" sounds more like something Deborah could've had on her last album, and ""Oh my Gosh"" is a catchy little tune but even these songs can't seem to redeem this album.

The blade depth is easy to adjust, and replacing the blade seems fairly simple.However, the blade that came with the plane tends to snag on the wood I am working with. Because this is the first time I have used a plane I cannot tell if this problem is due to my lack of experience, which it may be, or a problem with the product. Also, it would help if the plane had a rubberized heel so that when you use the tool it's a little softer on the palm of your hand.

"the heart of pearl jam: Pearl Jam achieved perfection on 3 albums; Ten, Vs., and Vitalogy. Ten was the commercial sucess, Vs. was a glimpse into the bands anger and rage, and lastly Vitalogy was the album that went into the heart of what Pearl Jam was truly about. The album delves beyond hard core rock songs and grunge ballads into the enigma which is Pearl Jam. Vitalogy is at times baffling, confusing and hard to grasp but at the same time the music is so rewarding and deep. ""Immortality, ""Satans Bed"", and ""Corduroy"", to name a few represent not the fading grunge era measured by time or teenage angst but by the emotions a truly great album can evoke. Vitalogy shouldn't be bought by true grunge fans but by true Pearl Jam fans.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

Why does the Tuscan reviewer dismiss this novel for not having enough dialogue? Silko presents the story through the eyes of very different characters. By not including much dialogue, we see the problems of communication between these people--they each feel separated. The reader is ""shown"" each character`s reading of the disturbing and interesting events. I`d recommend this book as strongly as Silko`s other works.

Terrible: I bought this monitor based on all the information that I read about it. The music and pictures don't turn on when he cries. We have the volume turned all the way up and the only way you can hear him is if you have the receiver pressed to your ear. We tried everything the instructions said and nothing worked!!! I was really impressed with all of the other Fisher Price Ocean Wonders items that we registered for except for this monitor. I would not recommend this product to anyone!,REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

"Great so far!: I shopped a long time for this handheld vacuum. I wanted something with power (a wall plug-in, that didn't need to be charged) and something that was quiet. So far this vac delivered everything I wanted. I work in a large open office area; the vac could be run while people were working and even talking and was not disturbing. It picks things up quickly and quietly and it is powerful too. I highly recommend it. The only thing is that it does get warm.

"A Classic: Before the DVD, I watched this movie a long time ago. I enjoyed it more this time. To label this a horror movie may not be correct. Frankenstein is not like today's blood and guts horror movies. I think I read a review that said it is not scary and it was therefore given two stars, if I recall correctly. Being a black and white movie helps give a eerie feeling. In close-ups of the monster's face, Boris Karloff's eyes looked creepy and inhuman. And, the scene with the little girl is terrific.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

He is also bigoted (he lumps gays and lesbians with pedophiles and rapists) and racist (""I believe that, unwittingly, Jewish supporters of the government-dominated welfare state approach to the economic and social problems of the black community helped to create the mentality that now produces anger and anti-Semitism in black neighborhoods."")

Although Sally's daughters are better portrayed than the grown up characters, teenage depression is simply not enough to save a lagging story. Jimmy and his angry ghost, the aunts, the conservative little town the girls grew up and Sally's love interest have very little place in the book and this does not help either.The only real success of the novel is Alice Hoffman's ability to ""feed"" magical realism into an impossible place",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

Honest Review here: i purchased this norelco from best buy it looked cool and was the most expensive one there so i figured it has to be good. came home was very excited opened it was very stylish i had a light 5 ocklock shadow going on so i decided to shave it. i had to go over FIVE times to cut most of my beard off and it left behind many little hairs. very sloppy job.i spent a little more and got the BRAUN shaver which is 10 times better even though it doesnt look as stylish and is bigger.,REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE
"Sweet Leilani: When I last visited Mauai I wanted to bring home with me the most beautiful rendition of ""Aloha Oe"" I could find. I asked a street kiosk salesperson what rendition she thought best, and without hesitation recommended this album. I bought the CD for that one song, and boy, talk about a lucky purchase!! Not only is Dennis' ""Aloha Oe"" the most beautiful rendition I've ever heard of one of the world's most beautiful songs, but there are other great songs here as well. He truly had a beautiful voice (tragically, Dennis died in Jan. 2001, aged 51, of an aneurism), and I was moved to also buy his other 3 CDs a week or two later.

The story takes place in 2019, the world has re-emerged after the Third World War. Neo-Tokyo, a city that has been beautifully created and drawn into a nightmarish gang ridden metropolis is where the main action is. Focusing first on a group of juveniles in a local biker gang, one named Kanada and the other, Tetsuo, the film sets you up for a wild thrill ride unlike any other. The film divulges into many story lines, exploring a strange government psychic project, in which experiments were performed upon small children.

"Good for small pets: I got this gate to keep my dwarf bunny from entering my living room when she's running around outside her cage. Since the doorway was so large, conventional gates were too small to cover it and larger gates had holes too big to contain my bunny. Overall, this gate has worked very well--it has even withstood the gnawing of my bunny. The only problem I had is that the gate gets shorter the longer it's stretched, which can be a big problem for a bunny that can jump over anything lower than 2 feet! Regardless, I haven't had any problems with the gate. I highly recommend it for people with small pets.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

It's mostly damage-control.For example, in the book Lydon laughs at the Clash for ""starting off so mad"" at their gigs that they got knackered halfway through. ""We were smart enough to pace ourselves,"" he claims.The truth is, the Clash stole a lot of the Pistols' audience because of their superior speed and energy. They played with such fury they made the Pistols look like a buncha hippie folk singers. It wasn't a matter of being smart; Lydon's band just wasn't as strong.That's just one instance.

"Disney's Sketchbooks - Great Resource for Artists!: This fine addition to the Disney Sketchbook series has many of the wonderful sketches done by Disney's animation department for Lady and the Tramp, including many pieces from the storyboards, and several sketches of scenes that never made it into the final film.Artists that would like to study the Disney style of drawing and animation should find this volume a terrific addition to their collection despite its rather high price. As a student of art, and a fan of the Disney style, I highly recommend any of these books for your library.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

"1st Class Overview of the Principles and Process of PE: Ideal for anyone involved in or looking at getting into private equity. The case studies have real substance and result in depth understanding (as opposed to just knowing) of the key challenges, issues and activities in the industry.It covers everything from staffing and careers in PE, to raising funds, developing deal flow and managing portfolio companies, with real indepth cases of the successes and failures of individuals and organisations.I've been involved with PE (from a management view point) for over 2 years, this book put many things in perspective and gave me insight into how others have handled issues similar to the ones I face. www.smartinvestorafrica.com",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE
"I love this player!!!: This is the second portable DVD player I've purchased and I love this one. The flip-up types of DVD players are so sensitive, if you touch the machine, the movie skips. I've used this player on a long train ride, in a plane, and at home. It's so compact, you can stand it up, hold it, or hang it from the back of the car seat. The one I purchased came with a case, an A/C plug and a plug for the car. The battery lasts for about one movie but it will play a movie while plugged in.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

I still have the original 1960's edition, and have bought a batch of others to give as gifts.Pity about the current edition - the yellow circle next to the A on the cover warns that this book is only for adults. That lawyerese addition kills some of the fun of the book.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE
"White Christmas is ""Widescreen"" Version...: It's a nice boxed set and the movies are crisp and clear, but White Christmas is in the ""widescreen"" format which is not listed on any of the product descriptions here...I guess that's why Amazon doesn't show the back of the box. It's disappointing to have to watch it with the black stripes on the top and bottom of the tv screen.

"hilarious and haunting: The best, most insightful, most bitingly funny novel about New York in the 80s I have read. The tightly wound plot unravels with intellectual suspense, revealing the hidden workings and interconnections of powerful and powerless, money and art, country and city. This is a stealth epic disguised as a comico-satiric memoir. An ambitious book about big subjects which at the same time brings into sharp focus a particular time and place.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

"Works, but Slowly.: After about a week I can safely say that the kettle works quite well. It is very easy to use, automatically shuts off when the water boils, and allows for easy pouring. My only complaint is that it is slower than other kettles I have used. However, the kettle still heats a good deal faster than my stove. When filled to the top line, it takes about three minutes to boil, which is not bad, but keeps me waiting longer than I would like. Overall, it is not top-of-the-line, but certainly good for the price.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

"I'D RATHER TAKE A CALCULUS CLASS: Sorry folks but in spite of all the acclaim lavished on this movie, PROOF is one of the dullest movies I've ever seen. Gwyneth Paltrow gives a shreakingly one note performance, whining and pouting, and maybe smiling once or twice in a role that reeks of self-absorption. Only Jake Gylenhaal salvages his role, and Hope Davis is as annoying as Paltrow. Anthony Hopkins looks like he has gas, and the movie is about as exciting as reading an algebra text. Yuck!",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

"As enticing as a bus-ride!: Despite my usual verbosity, this time I'll be short: what a boring and disappointing movie! The plot is turtle-paced and I've caught myself on acute desire to give the characters a good push in the back so that they act and speak faster. B Willis is somnambular and S Jackson should get a better haircut and change his shining violet raincoat for something less awkward looking. The viewer feels fooled in the end by rather an ordinary movie-trick.It's worth to watch it only to compare it with the over-hyped ""6th Sense"". Maybe I'm too harsh, but I consider it lost money.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

"My Favorite Looney Tunes In The Worst Film Ever: I had such high expectations for this film, which is probably why I was so disapointed in it. It could have been so much better. When Warner Bros. fire Daffy Duck, he runs off with a security guard(Brendan Frasier) to save his father from the evil head of acme(Steve Martin). Bugs Bunny and a studio executive(Jenna Elfman) venture out of Hollywood to bring back Daffy. It all turns into a quest for a crystal that can control the world. The plot is wacky and fun, but somehow, there are all kinds of holes and moments where the story isn't moving at all. The effort needed to pull this film off was not applied.The DVD treatment is better than this film deserves. A new short and deleted scenes are the highlights. I",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

Just what my wife wanted!: I gave my wife the Garmin Portable Friction Mount and she just loves it! She travels for her work several times a year and uses the Garmin GPS. She got tired of sticking it on the windshield and was also concerned about people seeing she had one. The portable friction mount solved those issues by having the unit on the dashboard and being able to move it out of sight when necessary. I highly recommend the mount as the best way to use a portable Garmin in your vehicle.,REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

"It works if you treat it right.: First time out of the box it worked perfectly. You just need to understand what you are doing. First, because it is a graphic program it REQUIRES 600 DPI. Instructions say this clearly. Trouble occurs if you decide to reset your printer to save ink with a ""draft"" or ""economy"" setting, less than 600 DPI. That will cause the merge and MICR to fail. Then, if you change computers or change accounts, you should uninstall the software, remove the ""data"" files from the ""program"" file, then reload it. When you uninstall, it leaves ""tracks"" that confuse the re-installation (conflicting DLLs and other leftovers). Also, after uninstalling, shut off yout PC to completely remove the ""tracks"".You do NOT need ""magnetic"" ink to print check",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE
